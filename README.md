Skype for Business 2019 Call Forwarding Tool
============================================

            

The Skype for Business 2019 Call Forwarding Tool is a tool that uses new PowerShell commands (Provided in Skype for Business Server 2019 July 2019 CU) in the backend to deliver centralised control of user Call Forwards set on the system. The tool has been
 designed to have very little learning curve as it has been built to mimic the Skype for Business client exactly.


**Tool Features:**


  *  No learning curve - it works the same as the call forward configuration on the Skype for Business client!

  *  Get the call forwarding settings for any user on the system. 
  *  Edit team-call groups members. 
  *  Edit delegate membersForward calls immediately to another number, delgates or contact.

  *  Set simultaneous ring to team-call members, delegates, number or contact. 
  *  Control when the settings will apply ('all of the time' or 'during work hours in Outlook')

  *  Set the call forward settings on one or a number of users by selecting them from the user list on the right hand side of the tool.
